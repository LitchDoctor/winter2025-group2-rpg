# Protect Humanity Player Guide
Welcome to the Protect Humanity Player Guide, the place to learn all about the game. In this document, you can learn about the different abilities. There is also information about each item's stats. There are some other gameplay tips as well.

## Abilities

### Attack
The attack is the most basic of all abilities. It will deal damage to the enemy based on your player stats. The stronger your character is, the more damage your attack will do. There is always a chance that your character's attack might miss though.

### Taunt
Try to draw attention away from the human and agitate the enemy so that they attack the robot instead. After all, it is about saving the human, so why not taunt the enemy to keep the human alive? Just remember, the robot won't respawn until after the fight if defeated.

### Defend
Defend against the enemy's attack. While there is a chance the defend is unsuccessful, a successful defend will cut the damage taken in half for that round.

### Heal
Heal the human for 5HP. It counts as a turn so the robot will not attack, but might be necessary if the human is running low on HP. After all, it is the human that must survive and it might be necessary to heal him to continue on in the game.

### Stun
Stun the enemy, making them unable to attack for a round. Sometimes a stun might not work, so be careful what you wish for. Try it out, maybe the human will be able to take out the enemy before they swing back.

## Other Tips
* It is not guaranteed that trying to run from an encounter will be successful. The human isn't the brightest and might choose to engage, forcing you to join him in battle.
* The robot is capable of dying in battle, be aware of this as it means the human must fight the rest of the battle without any help. If the human escapes alive, he will get a new robot to accompany him on his journey.
