### Operational use cases

## Use case 1: Player movement
* User is able to move the player model around using "WASD"

## Use case 2: Enter a battle
* User is able to "encounter" an enemy and choose whether or not they'd like to battle the monster
* There are two options listed: "start" and "run"
    * "start" will send the player into the combat scene
    * "run" will close the encounter UI and returns the player to the main scene

## Use case 3: Battle option: Defend
* During combat, user is able to select the "defend" option to take reduced damage from the enemy

## Use case 4: Defeating an enemy
* When the user successfully defeats an enemy (by reducing enemy HP to 0), the user is sent back to the main scene

## Use case 5: Pick up an item
* User is able to pick up an item which is stored in the inventory by pressing "E" when an item is in range

## Use case 6: Player Defeat
* When user HP reaches 0 (after both human and robot is defeated), a message is printed stating "you have been defeated"
* After message is printed, user is returned to the main menu

### Non-operational use cases

## Use case 7: Levelling up
* User experience and level up system has yet to be implemented
